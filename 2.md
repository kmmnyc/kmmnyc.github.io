[Verse 1: Olivia Rodrigo & Joshua Bassett]
I think of you when the wind blows
Every night, I've been countin' the days
I see your face almost every night
'Cause I just wanna be there when you wake
Sure, maybe Salt Lake is not close
Denver always seems so far away
But I'm still breathin' you in deep
But I hope you know that we're still close

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett & Both]
Because
The best part is knowin' there's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile, it's you
Even when you and I are worlds apart, I hold you in my heart
The best part is knowin' there's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile
Even when I'm a thousand miles away, I wish that I could stay with you
It's you

[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo & Joshua Bassett]
When I don't know what to do
I shouldn't fear
No, I'm never givin' up, never givin' up on you, baby
'Cause I'm never givin' up, never givin' up on us, baby
I wish you were here
There's no need to be blue

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett & Both]
Because
The best part is knowin' there's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile, it's you
Even when you and I are worlds apart, I hold you in my heart
The best part is knowin' there's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile
Even when I'm a thousand miles away, I wish that I could stay with you
It's you

[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo & Joshua Bassett]
You, you, with you
You, you, it's you, with you
I wish that I could stay with you
It's you

   
“Even When/The Best Part” is a song from the upcoming season two, episode three of the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. It is an accidental duet by the characters Nini (played by Olivia Rodrigo) and Ricky (Joshua Bassett), who are dealing with a long-distance relationship. They both plan to surprise each other with a song for Valentine’s Day, but they travel across states to meet, only to discover that the other is not there. Instead, they unknowingly perform these two songs simultaneously through voicemails to each other.

   
What has Joshua Bassett said about the song?
“Even When/The Best Part” is a truly special duet. I played guitar when we filmed it, and sang along to Olivia’s vocals in my ear while she shot her side separately! I’m stoked to see how it all came together and really think people are gonna love it! Hands down: one of my favorites this season!
